1. Straightforward representation of network and causal biology
2. Easy to find and evaluate contradictory biology, e.g. *A increases B* and *A decreases B* is easy to find.
3. The BEL Assertions are triples which lend themselves to network representation. Individual BEL Assertions can be combined/aggregated into networks.
4. BEL Assertions are packaged in BEL Nanopubs which encapsulate provenance and experimental context (required to evaluate a BEL Assertion).
5. The BEL Language is parse-able into a computable format that allows transformations and expansions for building a computable knowledge graph which can then be used in algorithms such as Reverse Causal Reasoning, Heat Diffusion or as prior knowledge for deep-learning.
