BEL is a language for representing scientific findings in the life sciences in a computable form.
BEL is designed to represent scientific findings by capturing causal and correlative relationships
in context, where context can include information about the biological and experimental system in
which the relationships were observed, the supporting publications cited and the process of
curation.
